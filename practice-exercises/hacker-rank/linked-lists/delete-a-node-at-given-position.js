// Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and the position of a node to delete. Delete the node at the given position and return the head node. A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The list may become empty after you delete the node.
//
// Input Format
// You have to complete the Node* Delete(Node* head, int position) method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node to delete. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. position will always be at least 0 and less than the number of the elements in the list.
//
// Output Format
// Delete the node at the given position and return the head of the updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
//
// Sample Input
//
// 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> NULL, position = 0
// 1 --> NULL , position = 0
//
// Sample Output
//
// 2 --> 3 --> NULL
// NULL
// Explanation
// 1. 0th position is removed, 1 is deleted from the list.
// 2. Again 0th position is deleted and we are left with empty list.

/*
    Delete Node at a given position in a linked list

    Node is defined as
    var Node = function(data) {

// This is a "method-only" submission.
// You only need to complete this method.
