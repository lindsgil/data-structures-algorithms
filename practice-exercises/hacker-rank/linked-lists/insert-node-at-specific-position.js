// Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, an integer to add to the list and the position at which the integer must be inserted. Create a new node with the given integer, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node. A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.
//
// Input Format
// You have to complete the Node* Insert(Node* head, int data, int position) method which takes three arguments - the head of the linked list, the integer to insert and the position at which the integer must be inserted. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. position will always be between 0 and the number of the elements in the list (inclusive).
//
// Output Format
// Insert the new node at the desired position and return the head of the updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
//
// Sample Input
//
// NULL, data = 3, position = 0
// 3 --> NULL, data = 4, position = 0
//
// Sample Output
//
// 3 --> NULL
// 4 --> 3 --> NULL
// Explanation
// 1. we have an empty list and position 0. 3 becomes head.
// 2. 4 is added to position 0, hence 4 becomes head.
//
// Note
// For the purpose of evaluation the list has been initialised with a node with data=2. Ignore it, this is done to avoid printing empty lists while comparing output.
