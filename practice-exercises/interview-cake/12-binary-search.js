// Suppose we had an array â†´ of nn integers sorted in ascending order. How quickly could we check if a given integer is in the array?

  //the possible positions of our target, so by -1 meaning to the left of the 0th index

  //if there isn't at least one index between floor and ceiling we have run out of guesses and the number must not be present

    //find the index halfway between floorIndex and ceilingIndex
    //round down to avoid getting half index
    var distance = ceilingIndex - floorIndex;
